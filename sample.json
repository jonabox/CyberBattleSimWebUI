        "scenario_description": "The Telco/Commercial Service Provider (CSP) provides communications capability between the utility\u2019s substation and headend/control center. Both wired and wireless based interfaces may be involved depending on the particular utility standards and site-specific constraints. Wired-based communication links can be analog or digital leased lines, while wireless interfaces are typically radio, cellular or even satellite based. To establish the Telco/CSP end-to-end communications, a point of demarcation (Demarc) is provided where the local utility owned communications infrastructure interfaces the telco owned network infrastructure (Error! Reference source not ound.). A knowledgeable threat agent can compromise the serial communications at the Demarc by intercepting and selectively modifying communicated data to masquerade as a user (man-in-the-middle) or replay attack, in which the threat agent captures control messages and subsequent retransmission with the intent of producing an unauthorized effect. This can potentially compromise both real-time (sometimes referred to as operational) traffic as well as non-real-time (sometimes referred to as non-operational) traffic. In the context of real-time data exchanges, the substation gateway or RTU in the substation or the SCADA Front End Processor (FEP) at the headend can be affected by manipulating command and control messages in the direction of the substation or information messages in the direction of the head end. In the case of non-operational data exchanges, IED settings can be potentially manipulated. Relevant vulnerabilities: Physical access may be obtained by unauthorized individuals to the utility or Telco/ISP, Unnecessary network access is permitted allowing access of threat agent to the demarc or within the service providers network CSU/DSU, System relies on credentials that are easy to obtain for access to substation gateway/RTU or SCADA FEP, Users lack visibility of unapproved access* to the demarc, Commands or other messages may be inserted on the network by unauthorized individuals* in the communication protocol, System makes messages accessible to unauthorized individuals over the serial link, Message modified by an adversary is either difficult or infeasible to distinguish from a valid message in the communication protocol, A copy of a prior message or command is difficult or infeasible to distinguish from a new legitimate message or command over the serial link. Impact: Loss of customer power, possibly to critical customers (e.g., hospital), Potential customer and utility equipment damage, Financial loss associated with any equipment damage or restoration to normal operations, Increase in public safety concerns (e.g., loss of heating or cooling on extremely cold or hot days), Negative impact on customer service due to increase in calls and complaints, Damage to goodwill toward utility. Potential Mitigations: Implement approved cryptographic algorithms to protect the integrity of communications and the cryptographic keys, Implement approved key management to protect the cryptographic keys, Detect unusual patterns of energy usage on Generation Automation (all utilities have some type of revenue protection scheme, but these may not be adequate), Detect unauthorized access in network traffic between substation and headend, Require authentication on all data exchanges, Encrypt communication paths for serial messaging by using bump-in-the-wire solution, Require multi-factor authentication by Telco/CSP to the device containing CSU/DSU units through service level agreement (SLA), Require tamper detection and response by Telco/CSP for the Demarc through SLA, Restrict physical access by implementing personnel security control procedures. 5.8 Generation Generation applications in the bulk generation domain are the first processes in the delivery of electricity to customers. Electricity generation is the process of creating electricity from other forms of energy, which may include a wide variety of sources, including chemical combustion, flowing water, wind, solar radiation, and geothermal heat. The scenarios that follow are not intended to be comprehensive but provide examples that range from an event that could threaten grid stability to those with localized business impacts illustrating the various types of vulnerabilities germane to power generation.
